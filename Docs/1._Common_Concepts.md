# Common Concepts

## Comments

- Use `#` for single-line and in-line comments.
- For multi-line comments, each new line must start with a `#`.

```qrtz
# Single-line comment
code stuff # In-line comment

# Multi-line
# comment
```

## Variables

- Variables are declared and initialized using `:=`.
  - A variable must be declared with a value.
- Use ALL CAPS to convey a constant.

```qrtz
username := "Randi"  // Variable (mutable)
NUM := 5             // Constant (immutable)
```

- New values can be reassigned to variables with `=`.

```qrtz
user_num = 2
NUM = 10      // ERROR: Cannot assign to a constant
```

## Numbers and Arithmetic

- There are two data types for numbers:
  - `int` for integers
    - E.g., `0`, `1`
  - `float` for floating-point numbers, i.e., fractional numbers
    - E.g., `0.0`, `3.14`

- All operators are binary and, unless stated otherwise, return an `int`.

| Operator | Function | Comment |
| - | - | - |
| `+` | Addition | |
| `-` | Subtraction | |
| `*` | Multiplication | |
| `/` | Division | Returns `float` |
| `**` | Exponentiation | |
| `%` | Modulo | Remainder of division |
| `( )` | Grouping | |

## Text

- We can manipulate text using strings, represented by the `str` data type.
- To create a string, place single (`'`) or double quotes (`"`) around the text.

```qrtz
"This is a string!"
'This is also a string!'
```

- You can output strings using `print()`.
  - Alternatively you can use `out()` which is a bit more primitive.

```qrtz
print("hello world")

# Output:
# hello world
```

- To use certain characters escape sequences are needed, e.g., single quotes in single quoted strings, double quotes in double quoted strings, etc.

``` qrtz
'there\'s no way'
```

- You can also use single quotes inside double quoted strings and vice versa.

``` qrtz
"there's no way"
'he said "no way"'
```
