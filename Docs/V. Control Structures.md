# V. Control Structures
## V.A. Conditional
- `if`, `elif`, and `else` work like Python.
	- `print` also works the same
```
if :: x = 5 : // The equals sign doing its intended purpose :)
{
    print :
    {
        "x is equal to 5" ;
    }
}

elif :: x = 7 :
{
    print :
    {
        "x is equal to 7"
    }
}

else :
{
    print :
    {
        "x is not equal to 5 or 7" ;
    }
}
```
