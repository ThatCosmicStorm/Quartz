# IV. Operators
## IV.A. Conditional
- Most conditional operators are the same as Python, but pay attention!

| Sign | Name                  |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| &    | Bitwise AND           |
| #    | Bitwise XOR\*         |
| \|   | Bitwise OR            |
| =    | Equals                |
| !=   | Does not equal        |
| <    | Less than             |
| <=   | Less than or equal to |
| >    | More than             |
| >=   | More than or equal to |
| NOT  | Boolean NOT           |
| AND  | Boolean AND           |
| OR   | Boolean OR            |
- \* I'm leaving the caret symbol `^` to represent exponentiation, again, having the proper symbol do its job.
