## i. Introduction

- Welcome to ReadAbl!
- ReadAbl is a high-level, interpreted programming language similar to Python (except w/o OOP, ew).
- ReadAbl places a *large* emphasis on **readability** and **clear syntax**.
- The language is mainly a concept, so you can't play around with it *yet*.

## ii. Other Names/Logo

- I acknowledge that the name ReadAbl (and its associated logo) may not be the best in the world for a programming language, so I am completely open to suggestions.

## iii. "ReadAbl Sucks" Warning

- Before we get into any actual features, here's a fair warning: ReadAbl may suck.
- I am giving you explicit permission to **flame me for anything** that sucks or doesn't make sense.
  - You may see **a lot** of things lol.
  - Buckle up.

## iv. WORK IN PROGRESS

- Everything shown about ReadAbl is incomplete and subject to change.
- To move on to the actual semantics of ReadAbl, go to the Docs folder.
