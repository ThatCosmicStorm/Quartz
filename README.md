## i. Introduction

- Welcome to Quartz!
- Quartz (formerly known as ReadAbl) is a **high-level** *interpreted* language.
- While inspired by flow-based programming, Quartz focuses on *imperative* and *functional* programming.
- Quartz loves pipe-based composition, i.e., taking data through a "pipe" of chained functions.

## ii. Example Code

- Once concepts have been decently solidified, this section will be properly updated.

## iii. Contributing to Quartz

- WARNING: Quartz may look and feel awful to you (at first).
- Have any ideas/suggestions to improve Quartz?
- Open an issue on GitHub (with the appropriate label, of course)!
  - I'll respond as soon as I am able and can formulate a good response.

## iv. WORK IN PROGRESS

- Everything shown about Quartz is incomplete and subject to change.
- The language is mainly a concept, so you can't play around with it *yet*.
- To move on to the actual semantics of Quartz, go to the GitHub Wiki.
