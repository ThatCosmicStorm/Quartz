## i. Introduction
- Welcome to ReadAbl!
- ReadAbl is a high-level, interpreted programming language similar to Python (except w/o OOP, ew).
- ReadAbl places a *large* emphasis on **readability** and **clear syntax**.
- The language is mainly a concept, so you can't play around with it *yet*.
## ii. Other Names/Logo
- I acknowledge that ReadAbl may not be the best name in the world for a programming language, so here are a few alternatives I made.
	- Priman
		- Same name as a conlang I made a few years ago
		- Just sounds pretty cool
	- SpaCeR
 		- "Spacer" because almost every token is spaced out.
 		- "C" because the family gave inspiration for the braces and semicolons.
 		- "R" because it stands for Readability
- If you have any suggestions or like Readabl as is, please let me know.
- If you have any suggestions for a new logo or like it as is, please let me know.
## iii. "ReadAbl Sucks" Warning
- Before we get into any actual features, here's a fair warning: ReadAbl may suck.
- I am giving you explicit permission to **flame me for anything** that sucks or doesn't make sense.
	- You may see **a lot** of things lol.
 	- Buckle up.
